- **Automated severity classification**: Converts CVSS scores to user-friendly CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW tags

### 2. **AI Security Consultation**
- **GPT-4 Turbo integration**: Custom security expert assistant with specialized prompts
- **Function calling capabilities**: Real-time vulnerability research functions
- **Persistent conversations**: Thread-based context preservation across interactions
- **Proactive research**: Automatically queries packages and CVEs mentioned in conversations

### 3. **Real-Time Package Intelligence**
- **OSV.dev integration**: Authoritative open-source vulnerability database
- **Version-specific queries**: Precise vulnerability matching for specific package versions
- **Cross-ecosystem research**: Query any package across 11+ supported ecosystems
- **CVE cross-referencing**: Direct lookup of specific vulnerability identifiers

### 4. **Hybrid Response System**
- **Instant templated responses**: Sub-second vulnerability summaries with interactive cards
- **Deep AI analysis**: Comprehensive security assessment with remediation guidance
- **Seamless transition**: Users get immediate feedback, then enhanced AI insights
- **Real-time polling**: Non-blocking AI response delivery with status tracking

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds
- **TailwindCSS + Radix UI** for modern design system
- **React Context** for centralized state management
- **Drag-and-drop file upload** with 10MB limit
- **Real-time message polling** with exponential backoff
- **Interactive vulnerability cards** with OSV.dev links

### Backend (Next.js API)
- **Next.js 14** serverless API routes
- **OpenAI API integration** with custom assistant configuration
- **OSV.dev API integration** for real-time vulnerability data
- **Formidable** for multipart file upload handling
- **Temporary file processing** with automatic cleanup
- **Batch vulnerability scanning** with rate limiting optimization

### External Integrations
- **OpenAI GPT-4 Assistant** with three specialized functions:
  - `query_package_vulnerabilities(name, ecosystem, version?)`
  - `query_cve_details(cve_id)`
  - `analyze_sbom_package(package_name, include_dependencies?)`
- **OSV.dev API** for authoritative vulnerability data
- **Supabase** for chat logging and session persistence

## Key Innovation: Hybrid Response System

BomBot's unique architecture provides:
1. **Instant feedback**: Templated vulnerability cards appear immediately
2. **AI enhancement**: Deep analysis arrives asynchronously without blocking
3. **Conversational flow**: Users can ask follow-up questions with preserved context
4. **Expert guidance**: AI provides business impact translation and remediation plans

## User Experience Flow

### SBOM Upload Flow:
1. User uploads SBOM file (drag-and-drop or file picker)
2. Backend processes file and extracts packages
3. Batch vulnerability scanning against OSV.dev
4. Instant UI response with vulnerability cards
5. AI thread creation for follow-up consultation
6. Real-time polling for AI response delivery

### Package Query Flow:
1. User queries specific package/ecosystem/version
2. Real-time OSV.dev API call for current data
3. Instant vulnerability status with severity badges
4. AI thread setup for detailed analysis
5. Interactive conversation for deeper insights

## Security & Performance Features

### Security:
- **No persistent storage** of uploaded SBOM files
- **Temporary file processing** in isolated containers
- **Automatic cleanup** after analysis completion
- **Environment variable encryption** on Vercel
- **Request validation** and input sanitization
- **Isolated AI threads** per user session

### Performance:
- **Sub-second package queries** (<500ms)
- **Efficient SBOM processing** (2-8s depending on size)
- **Optimized bundle size** (177KB gzipped)
- **Serverless scalability** (unlimited concurrent users)
- **Memory optimization** (~128MB per function)

## Production Deployment

### Technology Stack:
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Next.js 14 + OpenAI API + OSV.dev API
- **Deployment**: Vercel serverless platform
- **Database**: Supabase for chat logging
- **File Processing**: Formidable + tmp for secure handling

### Environment Requirements:
- **OpenAI API key** with GPT-4 access
- **Assistant ID** for pre-configured security expert
- **Supabase credentials** for chat persistence
- **Node.js 18+** runtime environment

## Competitive Advantages

1. **Hybrid Intelligence**: Combines instant data with AI expertise
2. **Conversational Security**: Interactive Q&A vs static reports
3. **Real-time Data**: Always current vulnerability information
4. **Multi-ecosystem**: 11+ package managers in one tool
5. **User-friendly**: Clean severity tags vs raw CVSS scores
6. **Production-ready**: Serverless, scalable, secure architecture

## Use Cases

### Primary Users:
- **Developers**: Package security research and version comparison
- **Security Teams**: SBOM vulnerability assessment and remediation planning
- **DevOps Teams**: CI/CD pipeline security integration
